            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>he Second Part of the</hi> Athenians <hi>no Noble</hi> Bereans: <hi>Being an Answer to the</hi> Athenian Mercury <hi>of the 11th of the Fourth Month, called</hi> June, <hi>in behalf of the People called</hi> QUAKERS.</head>
            <p>YOU were certainly very much in haste when you pour'd out such a <hi>Mouthful of Charges</hi> upon a poor People, that one half of them made good, must needs lay them as low as you wish; But they that count so quick usually reckon without their Host, and must count again; as indeed you do; for in an after <hi>Mercury,</hi> you retract some of your <hi>Charges;</hi> which shews, by the way, you went without Book in making them. To spare you, and save Paper, we will not repeat them here toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as we answer them: for they are both foul and foully given.</p>
            <p>Your first Charge is, <hi>We speak contemptibly of the Bible:</hi> But we hope not. Your Assumption has four parts of proof. 1. <hi>We own it not,</hi> you say, <hi>as an adequate Rule of Faith and Manners.</hi> For this you cite R. E.<hi>'s Apologyâ–ª</hi> p. 25, &amp; 43. And what you cite is true; but you cite not all, and so leave what you cite more open to exception, which is by no means fair. Love but Truth and Ingenuity more than you love your own Credit, or slight ours, and we shall not doubt the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, even in your own thoughts. <hi>R. B.</hi> tells you wherein the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not a Rule in all cases and circumstances, <hi>viz</hi> it was not <hi>Paul</hi>'s to go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to be shut up there, rather than go back to preach to the Churches in <hi>Greece:</hi> Nor the Rule of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Call, nor any Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ster of Christ to the Ministry; Nor with reference to their going to this or that Nation to preach the Gospel rather than any others. It is not a Rule to <hi>Prophesie</hi> as to when andor, what at one time or point more than another; for tho' it says, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>That all may prophesie one after another, as it is revealed to them,</hi> which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes the practice, yet it is not the Rule of those motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; neither to the Party moved to speak, nor to those that hear to judge aright: for no Scripture can tell me if I am moved by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God or my own Spirit, or a transformed Spirit; nor can those that hear, judge of it but y the Spirit of Truth. So that tho' the <hi>

               </gap>at you are such? By what Rule do you apply Scripture, nay, by what Rule do you believe Scripture? for the Scripture cannot be the Rule of your belief of it self: And therefore it is that <hi>R. B.</hi> in our Name, says they are not the principal Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners: <hi>But,</hi> says he, <hi>being a faithful Testimony of the first Foundation, they may be well esteemed a secondary Rule and subordinate to the Spirit, from whence they have their excellency and certainty,</hi> p. 38. And can you call this contemning of the Scriptures, without speaking contemptibly of the holy Spirit that gave them forth? He argues thus: <hi>If the Spirit only gives the Knowledge of God, and by the Spirit we be to be Led into all Truth, then the Spirit and not Scripture is the Foundation of all Truth, and the primary Rule: But the first is true: therefore also the last. Again, That which is not the Rule of Faith to believe the Scriptures, is not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners: But the Scripture is not nor cannot be that Rule; therefore,</hi> &amp;c. p. 38, 41, 42. You shew your selves too <hi>Mercurial,</hi> and ride Post over our Arguments, leaving them and the matter behind you. The Scripture you oppose to all this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. and which is all you answer, and enough too were it but to your purpose! proves only, <hi>that all Scripture by Inspiration from God is profitable;</hi> but it does not say, it is sufficient of it self for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of the man of God to every good Work; so is <hi>Preaching, Praying</hi> and <hi>Meditating</hi> profitable: but it does not say, that it is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all true Knowledge, and the <hi>only Rule</hi> of Christians, or a Rule in <hi>all particular Cases</hi> that may occur to men: And it is plain the Apostle referr'd to the care of a Pastor, and not to all particular occasions. Less does he say, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is not the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Christians;</hi> and if it be a Rule at all, it cannot be a subordinate one to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that came from it: No doubt but they are <hi>profitable,</hi> very <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable;</hi> and blessed be God for them; but must we contemn them <hi>unless we perfer them to the Spirit of God?</hi> the great and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rule of <hi>Christians,</hi> Jo. 14. 26. <hi>The Comforter shall teach you all things.</hi> Ch. 16. 13. <hi>The Spirit of Truth will guide you into all Truth.</hi> The Apostle commended the Church <hi>to the word of God's grace,</hi> which is inward, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32 See 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. which place at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes all Divine Knowledge to the Spirit of God, its Searchings and Revelations. Again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. &amp; 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 20, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

It abideth in you; and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anoining teacheth you all things, and is Truth and is no Lye: and even as he hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</hi> We will close with the words of Christ, whom all are to hear and prefer. <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 37, 40. <hi>Search the Scripture</hi> (or ye search the Scripture) <hi>for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life; and they are they which testifie of me. And</hi> (for all that) <hi>ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life.</hi> A most severe rebuke to the <hi>hetter Jews</hi> of his time; and as great a one to the Christians of that stamp now. They valued the Scriptures, but undervalued the Messiah when he came, that, from Scripture, they lookt for: What blindness was theirs, that knew him not by so many Marks as they gave of him, but turned the Scripture against him that testified of him? This is the Case of our Opposers with us at this day: They oppose the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to Christ the Word, that shines in the Heart, and will not come to him, the quickning Spirit, in themselves, that they might have Life; but think, by them, to have Eternal Life, and they are they that testifie of him. <hi>Know ye not your own selves,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5.</p>
            <p>This is the Doctrin that is our <hi>Crime,</hi> our <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> our <hi>Error;</hi> and we are <hi>Seducers, Deceivers,</hi> and what not, for asserting, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and pressing it.

Again, It is allowed among Protestants, that where the Scriptures or Sacraments are withheld from People, as under confinement, or providentially in Infidel Countries, there an upright desire or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion answers and supplies that want then they are not absolutely necessary: So every where, by consequence, where they cannot be had, they cannot be absolutely necessary to salvation.

And, lastly, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches were gathered by the Apostles before the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Scripture was all in being, which is so much more beneficial, proper and advantagious to Christians, both as to Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, than that of the Old Testament. And yet without that, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, in which time, doubtless, many fell asleep, they lacked no Rule: They had that which was <hi>sufficient, viz.</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, which taught them and led them in the way to Blessedness.</p>
            <p>Your third Proof. <hi>Is our equalling</hi> Apocrypha <hi>with Scripture,</hi> and quote <hi>S. F. Rust. p.</hi> 77.

            <p n="4">4. Your fourth part of the Assumption to prove your Charge, <hi>Is that we equal our own Writing unto the Scripture, and that it is the ready way to make it both Blasphemy and Nonsense:</hi> And from thence you are pleased to call us <hi>God's Ape.</hi> Waving all your Reflections, that edifies very little, and cannot honour you, pray observe your Proofs. <hi>G. Fox, Myst. p.</hi> 12. and <hi>Fr. Houghil, Anti.

What, make that <hi>Heresy</hi> which is the Root of all <hi>true Religion</hi> as well as <hi>true Ministry?</hi> Can a fallible Spirit bring People in to the Truth, or turn them to God? Is not the Spirit of God an infallible Spirit? And are not the Children of God led by it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. And we are not ashamed to say, That by that holy Spirit, we are often constrained to exhort, rebuke and instruct, as it giveth utterance; and that God has owned our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with a comfortable Harvest, blessed be his Name: But for equalling our Writings with Scripture, we have no such Expressions or Thoughts: It is a Word of your own, and a Conceit and Inference of our old Adversaries. There are degrees as well as diversity of Manifestations and Operations, but the <hi>same Lord, and the same Spirit:</hi> Yet if it will satisfy you, we have ever preferred the Bible to all Books,
<pb facs="tcp:172324:2"/> and Writings of Saints and good Men. You have other Proofs: You say, that <hi>G. Reff. writ to</hi> O. C. Thus sayeth the Lord, <hi>And that brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Blasphemer</hi> Nayler <hi>(whom we,</hi> you say, <hi>to this day imitate, defend and admire) says in his love to the Lost,</hi> The word of the Lord to his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved City; <hi>tho' the holy Scripture must not have that Honour.</hi> Now, know ye, if ye please, that we own the Style, and bless God his word is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and when it lays a necessity upon us, we can say in truth, <hi>The Word of the Lord:</hi> And it is or ought to be well known to this Nation, that we have spoken it in Truth; it having been fulfilled more than once upon those to whom we have been sent with it. And it is a Blindness and a thick Apostacy that has overtaken such as count it monstrous to have a Vision, or to know the Word of the Lord in Gospel-days. The days of Light and Life, the dispensation of Spirit and Power, and of the Word of that Lord, according to the notable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them sayeth the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee</hi> (speaking of Christ) <hi>and my words which I have put into thy Mouth shall not depart out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed, sayeth the Lord, from henceforth and forever.</hi> Also that of <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. <hi>In the latter days I will pour out my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon all Flesh;</hi> without respect to Nation, Age or Sex. But you are very disingenuous to thrust into your Citation of <hi>J. Nayler</hi>'s words, by Parenthesis, whom you say we imitate, defend and admire; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by suggesting, that we defend him in Blasphemy; which is more than you can prove by any warrantable Authority: However hereby you justify that piece of Cruelty, done in that unhappy Age and usurped Power (as you suggest) which many eminent and sober People were grieved at: This is abusive, and out of all bounds of equal Dealing, and we wish you may repent of it: For we are so far from imitating, defending and admiring him in that respect, wherein he gave occasion of offence and stumbling, that we did not only at that time disown his Proceedings, but he very solemnly condemned them himself, which was printed to the World; and he lived an humble, contrite and exemplary Life, and dyed, we believe, in Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we read our own Epistles in our Meetings and not the Scriptures,</hi> is not from disrespect to the Scripture, but because of a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and a word of Exhortation thereby communicated. If it were customary to read our Friends Writings, as the Scriptures are in the publick places of worship, and yet did not read the Scriptures, we should deserve your reproof; but that is not the Case, far be it from us.</p>
            <p>The last part of your Assumption, by which you would prove us to contemn the Scripture, is <hi>our using, with the Papists, detracting Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a dead Letter, a Nose of Wax, a Lesbian Rule;</hi> and for this you quote <hi>S. F. p.</hi> 48. It is low with you that you have no more Evidence. But now be Ingenuous, can you think we call the Scriptures so, or that we say Men make them so, or use them so? Lay your Hands upon your Hearts and think again, is there any thing more proverbial than to say, <hi>That Men make a Nose of Wax of the Scripture?</hi> But therein to joyn us with the Papists is still more uncandid; for the very place you cite makes an Exception to the Papists practice, who use such Speeches Tauntingly, that is, in slight, in contempt of the Scripture. Then <hi>S. F.</hi> doth it not in any such sense; why then should you make him do it Tauntingly and with Papists, when he so particularly provides against them both? You'd make ill Jury-men with such Latitudes. The Scripture of it self is a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> for all Letters are so in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and you grant as much in speaking of the word of God: but if they are made alive to any Soul by the application of God's holy and quickening Spirit, they become living to that Soul, as much as if the holy Penman had spoke them in his Ear; and indeed no words are living to any Man, whether writ or spoken, but as they are made so by the Spirit in the Heart of such a Man. But <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> That we suppose you reverence, speaking of the Bible, said, <hi>Is Religion placed in a Leaf? Fearest thou</hi> (Paper or) <hi>Parchment more than God?</hi> This had been Hainous in us, and yet it is true. A <hi>Lesbian Rule</hi> he styled it <hi>ad Hominem.</hi> The <hi>truth</hi> they declare is stable and certain, but Men twist, shift and wring them, and so they become like the <hi>Lesbian Rule</hi> that served all turns; and for that reason he urged, that Men should come to the Spirit of God, to receive the mind of the Spirit in the Matter therein doubted or controverted.</p>

Why, <hi>1st.</hi> You say, <hi>We make him a Monster:</hi> That's bad indeed, or you are very Irreverent, as well as Unjust in your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. <hi>Rob. Barclay, p.</hi> 306. you tells us, says, <hi>He has two Bodies.</hi> Suppose so; one you grant: The other <hi>R. B.</hi> calls <hi>Vehiculum Dei:</hi> Not two Bodies of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> How is it a Monster then? You are more <hi>Mercurial</hi> than exact. But pray consider, and better late than never: Did not all the Fathers feed of Christ as well as drink of him, do you think? Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>They did eat the same Spiritual Meat, and did all drink the same Spiritual Drink: (For they drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.)</hi> Now the word <hi>Body</hi> is figuratively used, as it imports a <hi>Substance,</hi> that is, the <hi>Food</hi> of the Saints, their <hi>Spiritual Nourishment</hi> and Subsistence. You should be more deliberate, and not so wild and adventurous in your Censures. Your second Reason is, <hi>That we say Christ is actually present in every one of our own Bodies;</hi> which you say is a greater <hi>Degradation to him than his lying in a Manger.</hi> But still we see you dont read the Bible, or remember what you read. Peruse 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Examin your selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves: Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</hi> So that what you make a dishonour to Christ, the Apostle makes an evidence of being in the Faith. But this is not the only point in which you two differ. Yet know that Christ being in our Body, is none of our Phraise, and shews, as in other Charges (and which you Ingenuously own in your 3d Mercury) that you imperfectly know our Principles, tho' you boldly censure them. But were it so, yet the Apostle had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Expression, who speaking of the Divine Manifestation of Christ, and God in Christ, in the Creature, saith, <hi>And this Treasure have we in Earthen Vessels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6, 7.

Howbeit know, if you please, we do think the Son <hi>distinct</hi> from the Father for Fatherhood and onship are certainly not the same. And the very place you cite of <hi>R.

Fox.</hi> But 1st, were these Letters are, you do not tell us, not give us any sufficient Authority for them, nor for the Truth of your Copies; which, upon so high a Charge, should, in common justice, have been done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Besides, they are given us in <hi>Fractions,</hi> and <hi>&amp;c.'s,</hi> as appears by your Breaks, and that is also unfair. For might not they write to <hi>G. F.</hi> and yet fall to pray and Praise God occasionally also. A thing frequent in Religious Correspondencies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if it were a fault, must it include a whole People? Was it Writ to them, or Printed by them? Be just.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it their Practice? if not, you are to blame; and if it be, you must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have more Instances, and fresher than <hi>J. A.</hi> who has been deceast almost 30 Years. But this shews your Uncharitableness, that any thing, at any time, or at any hand shall serve you to back your unweary and unreasonable Charges against us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And we believe <hi>J. A.</hi> was too good a Man to intend <hi>G. F.</hi> in that sense you take it, and <hi>G. F.</hi> to accept it, whose Labour was to turn the Eyes of People from Man to Christ, which lays the Axe to all humane and creaturely Exaltation. And <hi>G. F.</hi> lived a true Exampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

And as he lived he died, in Care for nothing but the Glory of God, and the Exaltation of the Kingdom of his Son in his People; and, as it was said of <hi>David,</hi> he left us in a <hi>Good Old Age, full of Days and of Durable Riches and Honour.</hi>
